Archive-Server-Project
======================
Project done for the system administration course [ LO14 ] at the University of Technology of Troyes.
We created a linux-based archive server with shell scripts, using Bash and AWK. The main options were listing available archives, browsing each file content, and extracting an archive onto the client-side.

======================
* Listing mode
* Extraction mode
* Browsing mode
  * ls
  * cd
  * pwd
  * rm
  * cat
  * clear
  * exit
